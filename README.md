### Procedural Generation
This project implements 1D and 2D Perlin Noise in JavaScript, based on Ken Perlin's original paper, "Improving Noise". It demonstrates procedural generation using Perlin noise, commonly used for creating natural-looking textures, terrains, and other procedural content.

## Features
1D Perlin Noise: Smooth noise values along a single dimension.

2D Perlin Noise: Smooth noise values across a 2D plane.
